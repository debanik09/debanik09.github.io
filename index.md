I am currently a final year undergraduate student pursuing Bachelor of Science (BSc Hons) in Chemistry with Physics and Mathematics as minor from [St. Xavier's College, Kolkata.](https://www.sxccal.edu/)

People sometimes recognize me better, by my nickname Wrik. I grew up in the university campus of [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/) in India.

If still wondering why an aspiring scientist. Well,

Engineering: where the noble, semi-skilled laborers execute the vision of those who think and dream.

Engineer: The Oompa Loompas of Science.
