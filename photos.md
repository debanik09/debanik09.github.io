Here's a collection of images taken over the last couple months. Initially I started this project to try and push the capabilities of my smartphone camera. Does it matter which tool you are using to capture the world around you? With the tech in modern smartphones progressing so much over the past three years I don't think it does. There are some limitations, especially when aiming for larger prints, but I continue to feel more inspired to capture the world when I can't feel the camera weighing me down. 

I've since started to enjoy the smartphone photography experience of shooting and editing on-the-go way more than any other system. 

All images below were shot on Xiaomi Mi A3 & Motorola G5s Plus and edited using VSCO app.
